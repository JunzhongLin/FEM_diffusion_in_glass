# Demo: Finite elemental simulation for the ternary diffusion of alkali ions in the glass
---
Numerical simulation of ternary diffusion of alkali ions in the glass for the ion exchange process. This a demo version for the origin project. Numpy and Scipy are mainly used inside the project. 

# Project background & Goal
---
Ion exchange is one of methods for the strengthening of cover glass. By exchanging out Li ions and exchanging in K or Na ions, compressive stress can be formed on the glass surface. The compressive stress formed can prevent the growth of crack, as a result glass can be strengthened. The compressive stress is related with the ion concentration after ion exchange and the properties of glass (e.g. E-modulus, Possion ratio). The aim of this project is to provide a simulation tool which can help to simulate the compressive stress after the ion exchange process given the specific ion exchange condition.

# Technical Details
---
There are various scientific paper discussing the binary ion exchange system of glass (https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/optical-engineering/volume-50/issue-7/071107/Ion-exchanged-glass-waveguide-technology-a-review/10.1117/1.3559213.short?SSO=1). The mathematical model used in this project is for defining the ternary diffusion system which is now mainly used in the glass industry.
